        <h2>1. Search Censorship Is Real ‚Äî and Region-Specific <i class="fas fa-eye-slash icon-inline"></i></h2>
        <p>Search engines like Google and Bing operate differently across borders due to local laws, government pressure, or cultural policies. As a result, the same search term can yield vastly different results depending on where it‚Äôs queried.</p>

        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In China, Google is blocked; Baidu controls 70%+ of the search engine market, operating under heavy censorship laws.</li>
            <li>In Turkey and Russia, governments routinely request removal of politically sensitive search results.</li>
            <li>In India, Google has complied with thousands of government removal requests ‚Äî mostly for political or defamation-related content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/government-removals/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Google's Transparency Report</a> for live examples by country.</p>

        <h2>2. War & Conflict Disrupt Domains and Hosting <i class="fas fa-satellite-dish icon-inline"></i></h2>
        <p>Political conflict doesn't just affect people ‚Äî it affects web infrastructure. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Ukraine, over 5,000 websites were taken down or migrated due to Russian cyberattacks and server disruptions.</li>
            <li>Western sanctions on Russia in 2022‚Äì2023 forced many global companies to disable services in Russian territories, including ad platforms and analytics tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout warning">
            <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
            <p>üìâ When domains become unreachable, Google deindexes them. If you have an international audience, you must use uptime monitoring and geolocation tools to avoid penalties.</p>

        <p>Platforms like Semrush, Ahrefs, Google Ads, and Meta Ads restrict services in sanctioned countries.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Semrush currently <strong>blocks access from embargoed nations</strong> like North Korea, Iran, and parts of Syria.</li>
            <li>Facebook and Google Ads are <strong>unavailable or limited</strong> in Cuba, Russia, and Venezuela due to international sanctions.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Google prioritized official health sources (WHO, CDC, NHS)</li>
