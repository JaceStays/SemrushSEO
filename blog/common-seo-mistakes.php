      <section id="ignoring-keyword-intent">
        <h2>üí° 1. Ignoring Keyword Intent <i class="fas fa-compass icon-inline"></i></h2>
        <p>One of the biggest mistakes is targeting keywords based solely on search volume without understanding the user's intent behind the query. Google aims to serve the most relevant results, which means aligning your content with what users are *really* looking for (informational, navigational, transactional, or commercial research).</p>
        <div class="callout problem">
            <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Many marketers target high-volume keywords without considering search intent (informational, navigational, transactional, commercial). This leads to irrelevant traffic, high bounce rates, and wasted effort because the content doesn't fulfill the user's underlying need.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout fix">
            <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Use <a href="https://www.semrush.com/features/keyword-magic-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semrush Keyword Magic Tool</a> to analyze intent-based keywords and match them to the right content type. Understand the "why" behind the search‚Äîare users looking for information, product comparisons, or ready to buy? Your content must directly answer that "why."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout pro-tip">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Create separate content strategies for transactional and informational keywords to maximize conversions and user satisfaction. A product page won't rank for "how to fix" queries, and a blog post won't convert for "buy now" intent.</p>

      <section id="not-optimizing-featured-snippets">
        <h2>‚ú® 2. Not Optimizing for Featured Snippets <i class="fas fa-star icon-inline"></i></h2>
        <p>Featured snippets ("position zero") appear at the very top of Google's search results and can drive significant traffic, even outperforming the top organic result. Many websites miss out on this prime real estate by not structuring their content in a snippet-friendly way.</p>
        <div class="callout problem">
            <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Google‚Äôs position zero (featured snippets) drive massive traffic, but many websites ignore snippet optimization, leaving valuable SERP real estate to competitors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout fix">
            <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Use <a href="https://www.semrush.com/features/on-page-seo-checker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semrush On-Page SEO Checker</a> to identify snippet opportunities. Structure your content using short paragraphs, clear headings, numbered lists, and tables that directly answer common questions relevant to your keywords. This makes it easy for Google to pull out concise answers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout pro-tip">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Answer common "what is," "how to," or "list of" questions concisely (50-60 words) immediately after a clear heading (e.g., "What is [Your Topic]?") to increase your chances of earning a featured snippet.</p>

        <h2>‚ö° 3. Slow Website Speed <i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt icon-inline"></i></h2>
        <p>Page loading speed is a crucial ranking factor and directly impacts user experience (UX). A slow website leads to higher bounce rates, lower engagement, and can negatively affect your search rankings, especially with the introduction of Core Web Vitals.</p>
        <div class="callout problem">
            <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> A slow-loading website not only frustrates users but also signals a poor user experience to Google, leading to higher bounce rates and lower rankings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout fix">
            <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Use <a href="https://www.semrush.com/features/site-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semrush Site Audit</a> or Google PageSpeed Insights to identify slow-loading pages and specific performance bottlenecks. Optimize images (compress and use next-gen formats like WebP), enable browser caching, minify CSS/JS files, and consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve content faster globally.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout pro-tip">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Aim for a page speed under 3 seconds on both desktop and mobile for the best user experience and SEO performance, aligning with Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds (Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, Cumulative Layout Shift).</p>

        <h2>üì± 4. Ignoring Mobile Optimization <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt icon-inline"></i></h2>
        <p>With Google's mobile-first indexing, the mobile version of your website is now the primary one used for ranking. A poor mobile experience (non-responsive design, tiny text, difficult navigation) can severely hinder your SEO efforts, even if your desktop site is perfect.</p>
        <div class="callout problem">
            <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Neglecting mobile optimization leads to poor user experience on smartphones, which Google actively penalizes as it uses the mobile version of your site for indexing and ranking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout fix">
            <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Test your site with <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google‚Äôs Mobile-Friendly Test</a> and use <a href="https://www.semrush.com/features/site-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semrush Site Audit</a> to detect mobile usability issues.

        <h2>üîó 5. Poor Internal Linking Structure <i class="fas fa-sitemap icon-inline"></i></h2>
        <p>Internal links are vital for distributing "link juice" (ranking power) around your site, helping search engines understand your site's structure, and guiding users to relevant content. A weak or chaotic internal linking strategy can leave important pages undiscovered or undervalued by search engines.</p>
        <div class="callout problem">
            <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
            <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Many websites fail to use internal links strategically, leading to "orphan pages" (pages with no internal links) and inefficient distribution of SEO value across their site. This impacts crawlability and content discoverability.</p>

        <div class="callout fix">

Add contextual internal links from high-authority, relevant pages to important underperforming pages to boost their authority and guide users through your content.</p>
