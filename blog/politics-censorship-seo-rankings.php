        <p>Google doesn’t always remove content globally. Instead, it censors regionally by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Geofencing SERP results</li>
          <li>Altering autocomplete or related queries by region</li>
          <li>Blocking Google Ads for certain terms in specific countries</li>

        <p>Example: A website about political protests in Hong Kong may still appear in Canada, but <strong>won’t surface in mainland China or Singapore</strong>.</p>
