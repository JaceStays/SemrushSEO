        <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem; margin-bottom: 30px;">Risky Move: Quit My Job, Moved to Paris, No Real Plan (Naturally)</h2>
        <p>
          I once just quit my job and moved to Paris. No major savings. A working holiday visa. A credit card that was already giving me side-eye. And yeah… I didn’t speak French. But I had just enough freelance gigs and just enough grit to figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          One client — a former lawyer turned badass professional coach — kept me afloat, sending me whatever digital work she could. I was doing my best to become a full-time digital nomad. It was not glamorous. It was just hard.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Then My Genius Friend Shows Up (Cue: Internet Magic)</h2>
        <p>
          Out of nowhere, my brilliant friend — the kind of guy who turns a $2K government-funded idea into a million-dollar business — came to Paris for 3 months. He said, “Let’s start an online presence company.” I said, “Hell yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He covered rent, paid for everything, and we got to work. He was the affiliate + internet strategy wizard. I was operations, creative, build. We made a great team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then his affiliate program started expanding into New Zealand, Australia, and the UK — and he handed those markets over to me. Fully.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 30px;">I Was Helping Affiliates With No Tools or Training</h2>
        <p>
          He didn’t train me. He didn’t give me a playbook. Just handed me the reins and said, “Go.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn’t just trying to grow traffic — I was helping <strong>dozens</strong> of affiliates figure out how to write content, drive conversions, and build their own streams of income. Meanwhile, I was patching together my own systems just to keep the thing running.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made it work — but damn, it was messy.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Then I Found Semrush — and Everything Clicked</h2>
        <p>
          Years later, I found Semrush. And <strong>finally</strong> everything clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could actually <strong>see</strong> what was working — from keywords and backlinks to competitor strategy and technical issues. Semrush pulled all the chaos together into one place. It saved me hours. It gave me clarity. It made me better — fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly? I wish I’d had it from day one.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Okay Wait, This Is Turning Into a Therapy Session</h2>
        <p>
          You’re not here to hear my whole life story. You’re here for <strong>your</strong> story.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you <strong>do</strong> want the whole saga — the risks, the reinventions, the wild ride from Paris to passive income — I dropped the long version over at <a href="https://berichnotpoor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="read-more-link">BeRichNotPoor.com</a> (and yeah, I own that).
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 30px;">So Why This Page?</h2>
        <p>
          Because I know what it’s like to be stuck, burnt out, and running blind. And if there’s one tool that actually made the difference — financially, mentally, operationally — it’s Semrush.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I’m an affiliate. (And let’s be honest — once you try it, you’ll probably want to be one too.) Yes, I get a commission if you sign up.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I’m not into promoting junk. I only back tools I use and believe in. Period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semrush gives you time back. It helps you stop guessing and start growing — with one dashboard that handles keyword research, backlink analysis, content optimization, and AI-driven recommendations that adjust as the SEO landscape shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re on the edge of an AI-powered marketing revolution. Semrush doesn’t just keep up — it leads the charge.
